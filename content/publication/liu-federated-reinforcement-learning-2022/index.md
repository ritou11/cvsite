abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with ``centralized training &
  decentralized execution'' framework has been widely investigated to implement decentralized
  voltage control for distribution networks (DNs). However, a centralized training
  solution encounters privacy and scalability issues for large-scale DNs with multiple
  virtual power plants. In this letter, a decomposition & coordination reinforcement
  learning algorithm is proposed based on a federated framework. This decentralized
  training algorithm not only enhances scalability and privacy but also has a similar
  learning convergence with centralized ones.
