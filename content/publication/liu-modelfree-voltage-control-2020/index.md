abstract: Dynamic voltage support is a type of critical ancillary service in electric
  power networks. With the increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable energy
  resources, utilizing their idle capacity to provide dynamic voltage support is becoming
  essential. However, the performance of traditional control methods is ofter limited
  due to the frequently changing operating point and network parameters, which are
  tuned only in a specific condition and suffer performance deterioration in others.
  This paper presents a model-free dynamic voltage control method for inverter-based
  energy resources to supply dynamic voltage support. This method can dynamically
  estimate the system with pseudo gradients, in which a continuous parameter function
  is proposed to adaptively approximate the optimal intermediate parameters. It guarantees
  the performance when the host system operating states vary without tuning the controller's
  parameters, while in comparison the PID controllers require the parameters being
  tuned repeatedly. Both numerical simulation and field tests demonstrate that the
  proposed method significantly outperforms the classic PI and adaptive PI controllers,
  especially in the case when the host system varies over time.
