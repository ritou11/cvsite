abstract: The energy consumed by commercial buildings for heating and cooling is significantly
  increased. To better cope with the uncertainty introduced by the high penetration
  of renewable generation units, exploiting the potential flexibility of commercial
  buildings is an effective solution. The parameters of commercial buildings are not
  onsite identified; hence, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods are integrated
  into the energy management problem. However, time delay commonly occurs in district
  heating systems due to the heat transfer process, which causes asynchronization
  between the state and the action and poses challenges to conventional DRL algorithms.
  In this paper, the asynchronization between the state and the action is eliminated
  by expending the state space to a larger but partially observed space, and the dispatch
  model for the district heating system is formulated as a partial observable Markov
  decision process (POMDP). Based on the finite difference method, this paper proposes
  a novel memory-augmented (MA) DRL method and utilizes dueling network structure
  to cope with the time delay caused by heat transfer process. The selection of the
  memory size is mathematically derived under a certain accuracy. Results from a case
  study of an industrial park demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed
  method.
