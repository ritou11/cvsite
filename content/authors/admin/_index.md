I received my B.S. & Ph.D. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Currently, I'm working on a startup company in the field of energy management system. My research interests include machine learning especially reinforcement learning and their applications in the energy system, active distribution system operation and control, model-free control and other AI applications. I am also interested in modern programming languages and frameworks. In recent years, I have become a rookie of the open source society.  As for sports, I'm a fan of basketball and swimming.
